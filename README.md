# Predictive analysis of medical health insurance cost using linear regression

A medical health insurance cost prediction model using linear regression to predict the health insurance cost of a new customer person based on current health insurance information.

Key findings:
- Out of several features/different charactistics, being a smoker has a high correlation target variable of cost (lighter in color or closer to 1 in heatmap) while gender/sex has a low correlation with target variable of cost (darker in color scale or closer to 0, negative in heatmap).
- Someone who is a smoker has a higher health insurance cost than someone who is not a smoker.
- The health insurance cost difference between a new customer who is a smoker compared to a new customer who is not a smoker is about $20,000 more.

Usage: Python, Jupyter Notebooks
