![2D4DB770-10C3-4D35-AD2C-A5484264C6EB_1_201_a](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63076021/233698078-c3d240ef-911c-47da-a8c6-e3104d8f32d1.jpeg)

A medical health insurance cost prediction model to predict the health insurance cost of a new customer person based on current health insurance information.

Type of model: Linear Regression

Key findings:
- Out of several features/different charactistics, being a smoker has a high correlation target variable of cost (lighter in color or closer to 1 in heatmap) while gender/sex has a low correlation with target variable of cost (darker in color scale or closer to 0, negative in heatmap).
- Someone who is a smoker has a higher health insurance cost than someone who is not a smoker.
- The health insurance cost difference between a new customer who is a smoker compared to a new customer who is not a smoker is about $20,000 more.

Usage: Python, Jupyter Notebooks

Libraries: Sklearn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
